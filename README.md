# Technical Support Center Simulation

This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for simulating a technical support center using the DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) framework. The project aims to model and analyze the operations of a technical support center, focusing on key performance metrics such as resolution rates, escalation times, and customer satisfaction. The simulation provides insights into optimizing resource allocation, improving service levels, and enhancing overall efficiency.

## Key Features

- **DEVS-Based Simulation**: Utilizes the DEVS framework to model the technical support center's operations, including case generation, routing, and resolution.
- **Tiered Support Structure**: Simulates a three-tier support system (Technical Support Engineers, Escalation Engineers, and Premium Support Engineers) to handle cases of varying complexity.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks key metrics such as resolution rates, escalation times, turnaround times, and throughput.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implements a feedback loop to update knowledge bases and improve resolution rates over time.
- **Experimentation**: Conducts experiments by varying processing times and observation periods to analyze their impact on support center performance.

## Repository Main Elements

- **Code**: Contains the Java implementation of the DEVS model, including classes for case generation, routing, support engineers, and performance analysis.
- **Documentation**: Includes the project report, UML diagrams, and state machine diagrams.
- **Results**: Contains the results of various simulation experiments, including plots and tables.
- **Appendices**: Includes sample knowledge base articles, support tickets, and a list of tools used.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Technical-Support-Center-Simulation.git
cd Technical-Support-Center-Simulation
```
### 2. Run the Simulation
Ensure you have Java (JRE v11) and the DEVS-SUITE (from SourceForge) installed.

Open the project in Eclipse IDE or any compatible Java IDE. Include the files of "Technical-Support-Center-Simulation-DEVS/CSE561Project/DEVS-Suite/Models/Component
/Project/" in the DEVS-Suite Project.

Run the Transducer.java file to start the simulation.

### 3. Analyze Results
The simulation outputs key metrics such as resolution rates, escalation times, and throughput.

Results are logged and can be visualized using the provided plots and tables.

## Key Components
### 1. Customer Case Generator
Generates customer support cases with randomized attributes such as severity, priority, customer name, and error code.

Simulates incoming requests to the support center.

### 2. Support Center Router
Routes cases to the appropriate support tier based on severity, priority, and product type.

Implements a skill-based routing algorithm to ensure cases are handled by the most suitable support engineers.

### 3. Support Engineers
**Technical Support Engineers (Tier I)**: Handle basic cases using a predefined knowledge base.

**Escalation Engineers (Tier II)**: Handle more complex cases by leveraging advanced knowledge bases and product documentation.

**Premium Support Engineers (Tier III)**: Resolve the most complex cases, often involving product code-level fixes.

**4. Transducer/Performance Analyzer**
Tracks and analyzes key performance metrics such as resolution rates, escalation times, and turnaround times.

Provides feedback to lower-tier engineers to improve their resolution capabilities.

## Simulation Experiments
The simulation experiments focus on varying key parameters such as:

**Observation Time**: Analyzes the impact of different observation periods on support center performance.

**Processing Times**: Examines how changes in processing times for each support tier affect overall performance.

**Resolution Rates**: Tracks the resolution rates for each support tier over time.

## Key Findings:
**Observation Time**: Increasing the observation time leads to higher resolution rates and more stable performance metrics.

**Processing Times**: Longer processing times for Tier I and Tier II engineers result in increased escalation times and turnaround times.

**Feedback Mechanism**: The feedback loop significantly improves resolution rates over time by updating the knowledge bases of lower-tier engineers.

## Results
The simulation results are presented in the form of plots and tables, showing:

**Resolution Rates**: The percentage of cases resolved by each support tier.

**Escalation Times**: The average time taken to escalate cases from one tier to the next.

**Turnaround Time**: The average time taken to resolve a case from the moment it enters the system.

**Throughput**: The number of cases resolved per unit time.

## Conclusion
The simulation provides valuable insights into the operations of a technical support center, highlighting the importance of efficient resource allocation, feedback mechanisms, and continuous improvement. The results demonstrate that optimizing processing times and leveraging feedback can significantly enhance the performance of a support center, leading to higher customer satisfaction and better service levels.
